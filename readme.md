## ProcessJumplinks

**Current Development Phase:** 0.9.4-beta<br>
**Requires ProcessWire 2.5.3** (works in 2.6-dev)

---

### What it is

Jumplinks is a Process module intended for ProcessWire 2.5, and is an enhanced version of the original [ProcessRedirects](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/148-release-redirects/) by [Antti](https://twitter.com/apeisa).

### What it does

The module manages your permanent and temporary redirects (jumplinks) - useful for when you're migrating over to ProcessWire from another CMS. Each jumplink supports standard and smart wildcards, so that you need not create multiple redirects for articles or blog entries.
